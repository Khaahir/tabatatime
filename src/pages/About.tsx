      <h2>About the App</h2>
      <p>Tabata Time is a minimal, high‑contrast timer built for quick workouts anywhere—home, gym, or park. The theme matches our bold logo: red power, yellow focus, black background.</p>
      <p>Features include warm‑up/cool‑down, keyboard controls, end‑of‑round beeps, progress bar, and browser‑saved presets.</p>
      <p>We keep it fast and free, with optional premium extras as a thank‑you to supporters.</p>
