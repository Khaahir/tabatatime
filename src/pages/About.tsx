      <p>
        Tabata Time is a simple, high-contrast timer designed for quick workouts anywhere —
        at home, in the gym, or outdoors. The design matches our bold style:
        red for power, yellow for focus, and a black background for clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features include customizable work/rest rounds, warm-up and cool-down options,
        end-of-round beeps, and a clear progress bar to keep you on track.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is always free. You’ll see a few small ads, but they won’t disturb your training.
